Getting the new "Google Glass"

## Overview

For my Google Doodle I will be creating a small animation that is a joke about the new Google Glass. I will be having a fellow take the O's out of google and then putting them on as glasses and then sweep the old letters away. My goal is for this to give people a chuckle and hopefully be something that I can put in a my portfolio proudly.
